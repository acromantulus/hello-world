# hello-world
My First Git-Hub repository
My name is Brad, I'm a software engineer at Computer Services, Inc. For the last nine years I've been working with SURE, and working in COBOL74. Recently my job has been changing and I'm now using TFS and Git along with C#, so I'm working on understanding the technology.
